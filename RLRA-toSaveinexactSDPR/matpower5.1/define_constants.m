%DEFINE_CONSTANTS  Defines constants for named column indices to data matrices.
%
%   This is simply a convenience script that defines the constants
%   listed below, consisting primarily of named indices for the
%   columns of the data matrices: bus, branch, gen and gencost.
%   This includes input columns defined in caseformat as well as
%   columns that are added in the power flow and OPF output.
%
%   bus:
%      PQ, PV, REF, NONE, BUS_I, BUS_TYPE, PD, QD, GS, BS, BUS_AREA, VM,
%      VA, BASE_KV, ZONE, VMAX, VMIN, LAM_P, LAM_Q, MU_VMAX, MU_VMIN
%
%   branch:
%      F_BUS, T_BUS, BR_R, BR_X, BR_B, RATE_A, RATE_B, RATE_C,
%      TAP, SHIFT, BR_STATUS, PF, QF, PT, QT, MU_SF, MU_ST,
%      ANGMIN, ANGMAX, MU_ANGMIN, MU_ANGMAX
%
%   gen:
%      GEN_BUS, PG, QG, QMAX, QMIN, VG, MBASE, GEN_STATUS, PMAX, PMIN,
%      MU_PMAX, MU_PMIN, MU_QMAX, MU_QMIN, PC1, PC2, QC1MIN, QC1MAX,
%      QC2MIN, QC2MAX, RAMP_AGC, RAMP_10, RAMP_30, RAMP_Q, APF
%
%   gencost: 
%      PW_LINEAR, POLYNOMIAL, MODEL, STARTUP, SHUTDOWN, NCOST, COST
%
%   See CASEFORMAT, IDX_BUS, IDX_BRCH, IDX_GEN and IDX_COST for
%   details on the meaning of these constants. Internally
%   DEFINE_CONSTANTS calls IDX_BUS, IDX_BRCH, IDX_GEN and IDX_COST.
%   In performance sensitive code, such as internal MATPOWER functions
%   that are called frequently, it is preferred to call these
%   functions directly rather than using the DEFINE_CONSTANTS script,
%   which is less efficient.
%
%   This script is included for convenience for interactive use or
%   for high-level code where maximum performance is not a concern.
