# RLRA-OPF
This package tries to solve the matrix low-rank approximation problem by alternating direction methods of multipliers. This problem can find its position in many applications. Specifically, we try to recover a feasible solution for the optimal power flow problem when the SDP (semidefinite programming) relaxation is inexact.
